LibStub.lua

; This modified manifest removes the naked (i.e. no manifest file) LibStub.lua file out of its own folder and combines it and its 
; manifest file within the highest level LibStub folder. This eliminates an extra directory level search and ensures that the 
; LibStub folder contains both a .lua and a manifest file. Please refer to the ESOUI wiki Packaging section for more information.
