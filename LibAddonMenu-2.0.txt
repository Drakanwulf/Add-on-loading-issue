; Added this directive to force the game to find a standalone LibStub add-on for the LAM-2.0 add-on. This eliminates the need for 
; LAM-2.0 to embed its own LibStub folder.
## DependsOn: LibStub

; LibStub\LibStub.lua
; This embedding of naked (i.e. no manifest) .lua add-ons is, in my opinion, a poor packaging structure because not only is the 
; the embedded LibStub code from an r4 version but the AddOnVersion number for the standalone LibStub(r5) version that is supposed 
; to be loading LAM-2.0 is 5; however, the AddOnVersion number for LAM-2.0 is 26 and because the embedded LibStub is naked, that 26 
; value is the only AddOnVersion number the game knows of as it tries to load LAM-2.0!
; I do not know how the game deals with these inconsistencies as it loads add-ons so these suppositions of mine could be far away 
; from what really happens in the game.

; The mistakes in the original LAM-2.0.txt manifest file have been corrected and their originals commented out so you can see the 
; changes more easily. This modified manifest removes the naked (i.e. no manifest file) LibAddonMenu.lua file out of its own 
; folder and combines it and its manifest file within the highest level LibAddonMenu-2.0 folder. This eliminates many extra 
; directory searches and ensures that the LAM-2.0 folder contains both a main .lua and a manifest file. Please refer to the ESOUI 
; wiki Packaging section for more information.
